The developed Voice User Interface (VUI) application called “Smart A Care” targeted at pregnant women and women in the postnatal period can improve antenatal health care services. According to the reviews, pregnant mothers’ mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended antenatal care visits during their pregnancy. Moreover, there was a trend towards more women receiving preventive health care services, more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred. However, overall, there is a limited number of existing mobile applications related to antenatal care services. We have developed a VUI application that provides the pregnant mother with real-time and casual chatting and voice conversation facilities. A Bot can guide the pregnant mothers throughout the conversation as a system persona. Pregnant mothers can create their account using their email address the first time they logged in through the application. This application provides appropriate responses to the corresponding user queries. The Bot can provide video links and relevant images when mothers request more information about their problems. Furthermore, the Bot can generate humour when appropriate situations.

As low-cost smartphones penetrate these regions, a new generation of mobile applications is emerging, requiring evidence-based methods to establish safety and efficiency. This study recommends that the VUI application provide antenatal care services. It is vital to a successful birth and makes pregnancy and childbirth safe for both mother and baby. To conclude, this application will include custom user-centric responses and other features like tracking pregnant mothers’ daily activities in updated versions.
